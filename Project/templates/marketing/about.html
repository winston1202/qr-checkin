                <p>
                    This project began with a simple request. A local business manager, a friend of my mother's, was facing a common but frustrating challenge: managing employee time logs accurately. The existing system was cumbersome, and there were growing concerns about the integrity of clock-in and clock-out times. It was clear they needed a tool that was not only easy for employees to use but also provided accountability for management.

                <p>
                    For many businesses, trust is the foundation of their team. But manual time tracking or honor-based systems can lead to inaccuracies, disputes, and what the manager politely called "deceitfulness." These small discrepancies add up, impacting payroll, project costs, and overall team morale. They needed a system that was fair, transparent, and removed the guesswork.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 border-b pb-3 mb-4">A One-Person Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    As a single developer, I took on this challenge personally. I believe that powerful tools don't need to be complicated. Every feature in QrCheckin, from the simple employee check-in to the secure geofence verification, was designed with one goal in mind: to be the simplest, most reliable time tracking tool a small business can use.

                    Being a solo developer means I'm directly connected to the needs of my users. There's no big corporationâ€”just a commitment to solving this one problem really, really well. Thank you for being a part of this journey.
