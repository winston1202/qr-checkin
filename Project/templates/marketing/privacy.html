            QrCheckin acts as a "data processor" for the employee time log data that our customers (the Team Admins) collect. Our customers are the "data controllers." This means that the Team Admin, not QrCheckin, is primarily responsible for the employee data on their team.
        </p>
        <p>
            We only process this employee data in accordance with the services we provide, such as storing the time logs and making them available to the team's Admin. We will not access, share, or use this employee time log data for any other purpose, such as marketing or advertising, except as required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Employees with questions or requests regarding their personal time log data should direct their inquiries to their employer (the Team Admin).
